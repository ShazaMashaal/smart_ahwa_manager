## OOP Principles

Encapsulation:

In order model class => _completed is private with controlled mutation via markCompleted()

Abstraction:

Here, Drink.of() returns a concrete drink, but the caller only depends on the Drink interface. The code doesnâ€™t care about the type.

Inheritance:

Drink type inherits from Drink, so they all share properties like type, displayName, and price. This reduces code duplication and enforces consistency.


## SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
OrderService only coordinates order-related workflows. It doesnâ€™t handle UI or storage logic, keeping a single responsibility.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
OrderService depends on the abstraction (OrderRepository), not a concrete implementation. This allows swapping the repository easily.
