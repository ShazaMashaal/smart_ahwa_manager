  - Customer name  
  - Drink type  
  - Special instructions  
- ðŸ“‹ Display live list of pending orders using **StreamBuilder**  
- âœ… Mark orders as completed  
- âš¡ Real-time updates without manual refresh

## OOP Principles

Encapsulation:

In order model class => _completed is private with controlled mutation via markCompleted()

Abstraction:

Here, Drink.of() returns a concrete drink, but the caller only depends on the Drink interface. The code doesnâ€™t care about the type.

Inheritance:

Drink type inherits from Drink, so they all share properties like type, displayName, and price. This reduces code duplication and enforces consistency.


<!-- ## SOLID Principles

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
Each class has one clearly defined responsibility. For example, data models only hold and validate data, while services handle business logic.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
The system is open to extension but closed to modification. New features (e.g., new drink types) can be added without altering existing core logic.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subclasses can replace their base classes without breaking the application. This ensures that derived classes conform to the expected behavior of their parents.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):
Interfaces are small and focused, ensuring that classes only implement what they actually need rather than being forced to implement unused methods.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
High-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This decouples components and makes the system easier to test and extend.

ðŸ§© Project Structure
Models â€” Define the core data structures (e.g., Order, Drink).
Services â€” Contain the business logic (e.g., OrderService manages all order operations).
Screens & Widgets â€” Handle the presentation layer (decoupled from business logic).
This layered structure supports scalability and future feature additions without breaking existing code.
